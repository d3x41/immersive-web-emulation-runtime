# What is IWER?

The Immersive Web Emulation Runtime **(IWER)** is a TypeScript-based tool designed to enable the running of WebXR applications in modern browsers without requiring native WebXR support. By emulating the WebXR Device API, IWER provides developers with the ability to test and run WebXR projects across a wide range of devices, ensuring compatibility and enhancing the development process.

IWER utilizes a universal `XRDevice` interface, configurable to emulate the vast majority of XR hardware with WebXR support, to offer direct and comprehensive control over the XR device in the emulated WebXR experience; Its potential applications include:

- **Custom Development Tools**: Empowers developers to craft specific WebXR tools tailored to their project requirements, bypassing the need for browser extensions.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Functions as an input remapping layer over existing WebXR projects, facilitating seamless cross-platform functionality and allowing the recycling of XR interaction codes.
- **Scalable Testing Solutions**: Offers action capture and playback features that unlocks automated testing of WebXR projects for the first time in environments without the necessity for physical headsets, enhancing testing accessibility and scalability.
